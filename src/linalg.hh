/**
 * @mainpage Linalg -- A C++ frontend to BLAS and LAPACK
 *
 * Linalg is a template library, that provides easy to use matrix and vector classes and a
 * collection of functions directly interfacing the BLAS and LAPACK Fortran routines. This library
 * is intented to be easy usable and able to deal with NumPy arrays directly. This implies that
 * all methods provided by this library can handle matrices in any storage order. As some functions
 * of the LAPACK library are not capable to handle matrices in row-major storage, these functions
 * are reimplemented in C++ in an efficient way using SIMD instructions where it is possible.
 *
 * The most basic data type in this library is the @c Linalg::Array type, which represents a
 * multi-dimensional array of values. It is implemented as a class template to be able to deal with
 * any scalar value type. Note, that not all operations are implemented for all scalar types. There
 * are two linear algebra types derived from this array class, (a) the @c Linlag::Matrix class
 * representing a 2 dimensional array of scalars and (b) the @c Linalg::Vector type, representing
 * a column vector of scalars.
